507,437,Mixed,Mount Taishan,"<p>The sacred Mount Tai ('shan' means 'mountain') was the object of an imperial cult for nearly 2,000 years, and the artistic masterpieces found there are in perfect harmony with the natural landscape.

508,438,Cultural,The Great Wall,"<p>In c. 220 B.C., under Qin Shi Huang, sections of earlier fortifications were joined together to form a united defence system against invasions from the north. Construction continued up to the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest military structure. Its historic and strategic importance is matched only by its architectural significance.</p>",,1987,0,116.08333,40.41667,2151.55,Asia and the Pacific,China,chn
510,439,Cultural,Imperial Palaces of the Ming and Qing Dynasties in Beijing and Shenyang,"<p>Seat of supreme power for over five centuries (1416-1911), the Forbidden City in Beijing, with its landscaped gardens and many buildings (whose nearly 10,000 rooms contain furniture and works of art), constitutes a priceless testimony to Chinese civilization during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The Imperial Palace of the Qing Dynasty in Shenyang consists of 114 buildings constructed between 1625–26 and 1783. It contains an important library and testifies to the foundation of the last dynasty that ruled China, before it expanded its power to the centre of the country and moved the capital to Beijing. This palace then became auxiliary to the Imperial Palace in Beijing. This remarkable architectural edifice offers important historical testimony to the history of the Qing Dynasty and to the cultural traditions of the Manchu and other tribes in the north of China.</p>","<p><em>Criterion (i):</em> The Imperial Palaces represent masterpieces in the development of imperial palace architecture in China.</p>
<p><em>Criterion (ii):</em> The architecture of the Imperial Palace complexes, particularly in Shenyang, exhibits an important interchange of influences of traditional architecture and Chinese palace architecture particularly in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>
<p><em>Criterion (iii):</em> The Imperial Palaces bear exceptional testimony to Chinese civilisation at the time of the Ming and Qing dynasties, being true reserves of landscapes, architecture, furnishings and objects of art, as well as carrying exceptional evidence to the living traditions and the customs of Shamanism practised by the Manchu people for centuries.</p>
<p><em>Criterion (iv):</em> The Imperial Palaces provide outstanding examples of the greatest palatial architectural ensembles in China. They illustrate the grandeur of the imperial institution from the Qing Dynasty to the earlier Ming and Yuan dynasties, as well as Manchu traditions, and present evidence on the evolution of this architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>",1987,0,123.4469444,41.79416667,84.96,Asia and the Pacific,China,chn

512,441,Cultural,Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor,"<p>No doubt thousands of statues still remain to be unearthed at this archaeological site, which was not discovered until 1974. Qin (d. 210 B.C.), the first unifier of China, is buried, surrounded by the famous terracotta warriors, at the centre of a complex designed to mirror the urban plan of the capital, Xianyan. The small figures are all different; with their horses, chariots and weapons, they are masterpieces of realism and also of great historical interest.</p>",,1987,0,109.259951,34.381311,244,Asia and the Pacific,China,chn
521,449,Cultural,Peking Man Site at Zhoukoudian,"<p>Scientific work at the site, which lies 42 km south-west of Beijing, is still underway. So far, it has led to the discovery of the remains of <em>Sinanthropus pekinensis</em>, who lived in the Middle Pleistocene, along with various objects, and remains of <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em> dating as far back as 18,000–11,000 B.C. The site is not only an exceptional reminder of the prehistorical human societies of the Asian continent, but also illustrates the process of evolution.</p>",,1987,0,115.922702,39.689449,480,Asia and the Pacific,China,chn
