The park and its underground network of more than 560 surveyed km of passageways are home to a varied flora and fauna, including a number of endangered species.</p>",,1981,0,-86.10305556,37.18722222,21191,Europe and North America,United States of America,usa
169,151,Natural,Olympic National Park,"<p>Located in the north-west of Washington State, Olympic National Park is renowned for the diversity of its ecosystems. Glacier-clad peaks interspersed with extensive alpine meadows are surrounded by an extensive old growth forest, among which is the best example of intact and protected temperate rainforest in the Pacific Northwest. Eleven major river systems drain the Olympic mountains, offering some of the best habitat for anadromous fish species in the country. The park also includes 100 km of wilderness coastline, the longest undeveloped coast in the contiguous United States, and is rich in native and endemic animal and plant species, including critical populations of the endangered northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet and bull trout.</p>",,1981,0,-123.4488889,47.74833333,369659.8,Europe and North America,United States of America,usa
289,259,Natural,Great Smoky Mountains National Park,"<p>Stretching over more than 200,000 ha, this exceptionally beautiful park is home to more than 3,500 plant species, including almost as many trees (130 natural species) as in all of Europe. Many endangered animal species are also found there, including what is probably the greatest variety of salamanders in the world. Since the park is relatively untouched, it gives an idea of temperate flora before the influence of humankind.</p>",,1983,0,-83.43555556,35.59305556,209000,Europe and North America,United States of America,usa

1672,1326,Mixed,Papahānaumokuākea,"<p>Papahānaumokuākea is a vast and isolated linear cluster of small, low lying islands and atolls, with their surrounding ocean, roughly 250 km to the northwest of the main Hawaiian Archipelago and extending over some 1931 km. The area has deep cosmological and traditional significance for living Native Hawaiian culture, as an ancestral environment, as an embodiment of the Hawaiian concept of kinship between people and the natural world, and as the place where it is believed that life originates and to where the spirits return after death. On two of the islands, Nihoa and Makumanamana, there are archaeological remains relating to pre-European settlement and use. Much of the monument is made up of pelagic and deepwater habitats, with notable features such as seamounts and submerged banks, extensive coral reefs and lagoons. It is one of the largest marine protected areas (MPAs) in the world.</p>",,2010,0,-170.14582,25.34907,36207499,Europe and North America,United States of America,usa
